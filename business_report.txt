    \subsection{The Approach}
    The innovation hub is designed to be self-sustaining, and helpful for businesses, so they can easily support the environment by purchasing products that are made from recyclables and other resources. In addition, opportunities will be made available for businesses to contribute to the hub, with the added benefit of creating employment opportunities for the economy.

    Essentially, the approach involves Contributors gathering resources from various locations, to be collected by the Collectors. They will then take the materials, and pay the contributors based on their contribution amounts. From here, Plastic Manufacturers will pay for the resources, and process/manufacture finished goods. The Logistics companies will then deal with the sales, and transport of these products to be sold to client businesses. Furthermore, these businesses sell to customers, starting the cycle once again, as the customers become Contributors.

    There will be three main components to the innovation hub project, Contributors, Collectors, Plastic Manufacturers and Logistic Companies.

    \subsection{Contributors}
    With a target demographic of ‘every day people’, almost everyone is a potential candidate to become a contributor. These people will provide the waste, to be used as raw resources to begin the process.

    Various companies could be brought into this part of the hub, including advertising or incentive based businesses, or any companies that could make it easier for contributors to recycle. For example, to maximise the efficiency of the recycling process we are partnering with smart bin technology companies. Smart bin technology involves fitting fill-level sensors to report the capacity of the bin. This can be used to provide data insights tracking the capacity of the bin and coupled with garbage collection fleet data enabling the use of predictive technology to optimise route planning for bin collection and reducing associated costs. In addition to this we are also allowing the inclusion of [insert example for reward system to make people recycle, e.g. apps/competitions etc.]

    \subsection{Collectors}
    This aspect of the project relates to the businesses dedicated to gathering materials and resources for the plastic manufacturers. This includes resources such as the plastics recycled by the community.

    Technologies that will assist this particular stage include data systems to record resource amounts that contributors gather. Using linear barcoding to store information (such as account numbers), a system to track and pay contributors based on their contribution amount will be utilized. Linear Barcodes will be used to scan customer ids on their bin, to be associated with an account. In comparison to QR codes – which can hold more information – linear barcodes will be preferred as the required scanning equipment is of lower expense (needing only 1D scanners), and these barcodes are more reliable when scratched or damaged. Hence, label manufacturers and data companies will be required to produce these barcodes, and develop systems to integrate with the hub.

    
    \subsection{Plastic Manufacturers}
    Plastic Manufacturers are a key element of the project, working as the intermediary processor of resources to prepare them for selling.
 
   Technology is key in increasing the quality of recycled plastic, and the efficiency of the recycling process. According to a study at Chalmers University, all kinds of plastics can be recycled. The research group led by Henrik Thunman, Professor of Energy Technology, introduces the circular use of plastic, which perfectly fits the purpose of the hub. Using this technology, recycling the plastic that is collected will allow it to be processed into brand new products.
    
    \subsection{Logistics}
    Focused on selling and transporting the goods to clients, this part of the hub is concerned with the more traditional aspects of business, and is the main point of contact for customers looking to purchase finished goods.
  
In addition to this, the logistics component will take part in this cycle by transporting the waste to the hub, and then distributing the plastic products that are produced. Data shows that China is the country that consumes the most plastic; ranked first place for total plastic waste by country, which was up to 75%.
